# Turtle on a grid

Given a grid of 0s and 1s, where 0 means open space and 1 means a wall,
find the route a turtle should follow to get from the top right cornet to
the bottom left corner.

Additional notes:

1. there is always a solution
2. there is never a wall in the top left corner, or in the bottom right corner
3. if there are multiple solutions, any solution is fine

Example:

    0000
    1101
    0000
    1110
